# Lung-Cancer-Detection
# A CNN model trained on Kaggle dataset using Deep Learning

# The automatic lung cancer detection approach makes detection easier, while also
# significantly increasing the patientâ€™s chances of survival. Convolutional neural networks for lung
# cancer categorization have helped pave the way for better cancer detection and accuracy.

# User can simply upload its CT scan images and the Model can predict whether it is Squamous lung cancer or Adenocarcinoma Lung cancer or if it's normal.
